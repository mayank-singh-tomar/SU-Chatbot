# SU - Chatbot
# üìö About the Project
College Chatbot is a smart question-answering web application built for our college.
It helps users (students, faculty, visitors) get quick and accurate answers to any college-related queries.

The chatbot uses advanced AI techniques like vector embeddings, sentence transformers, and LLama API (via Groq) to understand user queries and provide intelligent responses.

Additionally, it collects user feedback to keep improving over time and uses KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) to group questions by topics, helping us understand areas of interest through graphical analysis.

# ‚ú® Features
Ask any question related to college

Accurate and intelligent answers powered by LLama API and embeddings

Feedback system to rate chatbot responses

KNN-based topic clustering for user queries

Graphical representation of popular user interests

Simple and clean user interface

# ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
Backend: Python (Flask)

Frontend: HTML, CSS

AI/ML:

Sentence Transformers (for vector embeddings)

LLama API (via Groq) for response generation

KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) for topic grouping

Visualization: (Matplotlib / Plotly) (you can mention if you used any specific library for graphs)

# üöÄ How It Works
User asks a question on the chatbot.

Sentence Transformer creates an embedding of the question.

LLama API generates a natural, meaningful answer.

User feedback (Good/Bad/Rating) is collected to evaluate and improve the chatbot.

KNN Algorithm groups the questions into topics/clusters.

Graph is generated showing which topics users are most interested in.

# üñ•Ô∏è How to Use
